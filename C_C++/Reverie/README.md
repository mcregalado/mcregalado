# Reverie

**Reverie** is a conceptual project inspired by my aspiration to become a **game developer**.  
For this project, I designed an **inventory system** presented as an interactive **game mechanic**, combining storytelling with basic system functionality.

## Project Overview

The inventory system was developed using **C++** within the **Code::Blocks IDE**.  
Players can create their own accounts and log into the main inventory system, where a simple story unfolds to guide their experience.

Once logged in, players can view their available items and perform several actions to manage their inventory:

-  **Add** new equipment with unique characteristics  
-  **Edit** existing or previously stored equipment  
-  **Dispose** of any equipment they wish to remove

##  Concept

The title **“Reverie”** reflects the idea of imagination and vision — a fitting representation of both the creative process behind game development and the dreamlike world this project aims to simulate.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks  

---

##  Academic Context
**Reverie** was created as a **1st Year, Second Semester Final Project**, demonstrating foundational programming concepts and system design through an applied game-inspired framework.
