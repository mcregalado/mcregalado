The title “Reverie” is actually a concept that I came up with in correlation to what I’m pursuing to be – a game developer. 
Hence, I took this opportunity to do an inventory system in the form of a game mechanic. The system is coded through the use 
of an integrated development environment, “CodeBlocks”, while using C++ as the programming language. The player will be asked 
to create an account of their own and apply that account to log into the main inventory system wherein a type of story will 
take place and will provide further information to the player. They are able to see the contents that are already given and 
inside the inventory. As well as they can perform a particular set of actions such as: (a.) Adding a new equipment with its 
own set of characteristics, (b.) Editing current or previously stored equipment, and (c.) disposing of an equipment if the 
player desires to remove or delete a certain equipment among the contents in the inventory.
